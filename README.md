These simple yet cool javascript projects are meant to sharpen our programming skills by actually builing the projects out and understanding how they work.

I added comments in these projects so I can come back to them as a reference. Years from now it will be nostalgic tp come back to them and look at how far I have come as well as how programming as a whole has progressed.
