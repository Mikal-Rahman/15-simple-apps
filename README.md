These simple yet cool javascript projects are meant to sharpen our programming skills by actually builing the projects out and understanding how they work.

I added comments in these projects so I can come back to them as a reference. Years from now it will be nostalgic tp come back to them and look at how far I have come as well as how programming as a whole has progressed.

--------Counter App README--------
Here is a project where you can take the logic learned from doing codewars and actually see it in action on the screen.

A basic count up, count down and reset button with a bit of css too make it look neat!
